                                          Disease Classification Using SVM


This project uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify heart disease and diabetes based on provided datasets. The dataset was first split into train, test and validate. And then, SVM algorithm is used for classification

Requirements

    Python 3.12
    
    pandas
    
    scikit-learn
    
    matplotlib
    
    seaborn

Usage

    Ensure that heart.csv and diabetes.csv are in the same directory as the script.

Run the script:
    python svm_classifier.py

Data
    
    Heart Disease Dataset (heart.csv): Dataset for heart disease prediction.
    
    Diabetes Dataset (diabetes.csv): Dataset for diabetes prediction.
